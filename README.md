* Playful
* Aesthetic
* Performant

#### Philosophy

>TLDR: An open source [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) for [Flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs) projects

>Ever since Ada Lovelace learned to tie her shoes I have been scouring the internet for tools. I started programming when I was 15 using [Stencyl](http://www.stencyl.com/ "Stencyl") to make mobile apps and [Flash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhvey_FjtXA "Flash games r cool") games. My productivity was stellar, but I was limited in what I could create without an understanding of Haxe, linear algebra, and underlying hardware capabilities.
>* I learned Python and tried to use Pygame, my game was too slow at runtime.
>* I learned C++ and tried to write game engines from scratch, my game took too long to program.
>* I learned Unity, Unreal, and Godot... I felt like my designs were distorted to standardize into these frameworks: preconceived geometric hierarchies and syntactical constraints about how paracosms should be expressed.

>I dream of better workflows, editors where scene graphs melt into the aether: replaced by contextual intent expression.

#### Roadmap
* Symbol graph persistence (component and system module saving/loading, interoperable resource format import/export (like html or tiff))
* Graphic file system query navigation
* Replace OpenGL renderer with Vulkan
* Hot reload modified assets and code
* Visual symbol eye candy (round corners, custom shader composition)
* Game underlay UX (interacting with a distinct flecs world as a symbol, wearenotart demo)
* Reverse engineer PureRef save format and create coverter
* libclang runtime (live component and system manipulation)
* Video symbol
* Web editor
* Cloud project syncing
* local speech recognition dep (silero-models)
* local object detection search dep (probably Darknet YOLO or PyTorch)
* IsItPixelArt (automate image scaling algorithm selection)
* ECS port of FreeCAD
