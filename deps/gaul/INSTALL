Brief GAUL Installation Instructions
====================================

Full (and maybe more up-to-date) instructions are available on the GAUL website.  This file should have just enough detail to help you.

Dependencies:
The only non-trivial prerequisite for GAUL is S-Lang.  This may be obtained from http://www.s-lang.org/

Also helpful, are Perl5 and the GNU maketools.  You probably have these already if you use your computer for anything non-trivial.

Installation from Source
========================

You should be able to work it out, but for any real dummies out there follow the standard GNU make procedure:
./configure ; make

Or if you don't have S-Lang installed:
./configure --enable-slang=no ; make

If that doesn't work because you don't have the GNU maketools (or because I made assumptions that are not valid for your native compiler) then we have a problem to sort out.

There are several configuration options available for more advanced users.  For details:
./configure --help

On some systems, including Solaris, AIX and IRIX, you may need to specify GNU make instead the native make.  In these cases substitute 'make' with 'gmake'.

If you grabbed this source directly from the CVS archive and are using anything other than Linux, you will probably need to do something like this:
automake -i ; autoconf ; ./configure --disable-cvs-deps ; gmake
The above sequence is known to work for AIX and IRIX, whilst the more simple "./configure ; make" definitely does not.

If you plan to use the Intel C/C++ compiler, use:
./configure --disable-cvs-deps ; automake -i ; make

Two additional configuration options that you may find useful are:
./configure --with-efence      # Link with the electric fence malloc debugger.
./configure --enable-mpi=yes   # Link with the MPI message passing libraries for parallel code.
(Obviously you need to install the relevant software for those options to work!)

Email me if:
- You have tried the GNU tools, which you know normally work on your system, but GAUL still doesn't compile (preferably with patches to fix it ;))
- You would like precompiled binaries.  Note: I can guarantee to provide Linux binaries only.  I may possibly be able to acquire other binaries, but don't hold your breath. (Send the output from 'uname -a' so I can generate binaries with the correct format -- Or even better, provide the file "config.h" which is produced by running "configure").

Potentially supported platforms:
- Linux and other (mostly) POSIX-compliant UNIX OSs on any sensible hardware.  e.g. *BSD, IRIX, Solaris.
- Non-toy OSs which are POSIX-compliant.  e.g. BeOS, QNX.

An up-to-date list of supported platforms is available at http://gaul.sourceforge.net/platforms.html

Installation of Binary RPM
==========================
Assuming that the RPM package is in your current directory, and [version] and [arch] relate to the correct version number and computer platform, respectively, become the root user and type:
rpm -Uvh gaul-devel-[version].[arch].rpm

Of course, this only works on computers using the RPM package management system.
