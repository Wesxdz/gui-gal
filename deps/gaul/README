Introduction to GAUL
--------------------

The Genetic Algorithm Utility Library (or, GAUL for short) is a flexible
programming library designed to aid in the development of applications
that require the use of genetic algorithms. It provides data structures
and functions for handling and manipulation of the data required for a
genetic algorithm. Additional stochastic algorithms are provided for
comparison to the genetic algorithms. Much of the functionality is also
available through a simple S-Lang interface.

GAUL is OSI Certified Open Source Software.

Current features include:

 * Darwinian, Lamarckian or Baldwinian evolutionary schemes.
 * Both steady-state and generation-based GAs included.
 * The island model of evolution is available.
 * Chromosome datatype agnostic. A selection of common chromosome types is built-in.
 * Includes most of the usual crossover, mutation and selection operators.
 * Allows user-defined GA operators, icluding:
     o crossover, mutation, selection, adaptation, replacement.
 * Availability of multiple chromosome genomes.
 * Full support for multiple, simultaneously evolved, populations.
 * Choice of high-level or low-level interface functions.
 * Additional optimisation algorithms for local optimisation or comparative purposes:
     o Hill climbing.
     o Tabu Search.
     o Simulated annealling.
     o Simplex Search.
     o Steepest Ascents.
     o Deterministic Crowding.
 * Trivial to extend using external code via the built-in code hooks.
 * May be driven by, or extended by, simple yet powerful S-Lang scripts.
 * Support for multiprocessor calculations on various architectures:
     o MPI
     o OpenMP 2.0
     o pthreads
     o forked-process model
 * Written using highly portable C code.

The current primary aims for the GAUL development project are to produce
documentation, examples and test cases for this open-source release of
GAUL. Several new features are also planned for GAUL including wrappers
to enable its use with programming languages other than C.

The main development platform for GAUL is Linux with the gcc compiler,
but it should be fairly trivial to use GAUL on any POSIX compliant
systems.  Recent versions of GAUL have been successfully used a variety
of operating systems, including RedHat Linux, FreeBSD, Sun's Solaris and
SGI's IRIX.  Full use is made of the GNU maketools to aid portability
issues.  A table of fully compatible platforms is located at
http://gaul.souceforge.net/platforms.html
